### Reflections and Comments

* This assignment was fairly straightforward. I'm interested in learning more about the different licensing that is provided by GitHub, as well as understanding gitignore files.

* The assignment took me about 30 minutes total to complete. The biggest difficulty was making lighthouse work. My issue was the recursive functions I had created to ensure the user has to input an answer to the prompts. However, I think that prevented Lighthouse from working, so I changed the function to longer be recursive.

#### Update

* With the latest assignment, we added the use of arrays and loops. It was a bit tricky to figure out, but I had fun solving the problems I was facing.
* This time the assignment took about an hour and a half to figure everything out. Some of the difficulties I ran into were CSS and HTML related. I couldn't get the Roman numerals to show and ended up having to put padding on the left side of the list.

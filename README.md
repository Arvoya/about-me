### Reflections and Comments

* This assignment was fairly straightforward. I'm interested in learning more about the different licensing that is provided by GitHub, as well as understanding gitignore files.

* The assignment took me about 30 minutes total to complete. The biggest difficulty was making lighthouse work. My issue was the recursive functions I had created to ensure the user has to input an answer to the prompts. However, I think that prevented Lighthouse from working, so I changed the function to longer be recursive.
